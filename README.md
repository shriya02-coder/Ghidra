# Ghidra

Ghidra is a powerful and free reverse engineering tool developed by the US National Security Agency
(NSA). Reverse engineering is the process of dissecting software (in the form of executable files) to
understand its underlying structure and functionality. Ghidra translates the machine code (binary) of
software back into a human-readable format, allowing analysts to review, analyze, and understand the
software's operations.
